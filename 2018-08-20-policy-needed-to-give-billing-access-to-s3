#this is the policy needed to give the billing report access
#it needs to the s3 bucket I created to hold its reports
#however, it doesnt work if I use my own account number
#most peculiar

#this is from the well-architected session on 8/13/2018
#it is, in fact, the script suggested by the dialogs
#that create the billing report.  First time I tried it
#in early august it didn't work even with the suggested
#script.  In this case, I merely substituted the name
#of the bucket I created.
